# My first project on react and socket.io!

Here are two work dir with it own package.json for react and for express (second in server dir).
Type in cmd 'npm i' and then 'npm start' first in server dir and second in main dir.
Each client can display data from server and send data to server.

In work: 
  * user name
  * connect/disconnect in chat messages
  * online users
  * saving history on server in mongodb

Made by merging official guides by socket.io and react.
